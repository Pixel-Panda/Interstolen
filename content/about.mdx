## Ethos

I enjoy working computers. Ricing my Arch Linux machine, tinkering with Neovim, designing websites, or building developer tools. I'm fascinated by the web, creating and experimenting with interfaces and interactions to unlock new potentials and build something cool.

I struggle with completing things. I'm always rather begrudged at the status of my work and projects, always looking for ways to improve it. I have redesigned this website over seven times alone. Inside me rests an unsatisfiable urge of perfection.

Trying to find satisfaction in minimalism, starting with the redesign of this website. Using today to build the tomorrow that I want.
